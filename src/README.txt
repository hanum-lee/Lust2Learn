 Well, this was an interesting one! I've done something similar with HTML Canvas before, but I've never delved into p5.js. It took a lot of reading of both Florin's code and the API reference material to grasp every little bit. I've commented as usual to make sure I take away as much info as possible. I'm going to rewrite this by myself now and add a new twist!
